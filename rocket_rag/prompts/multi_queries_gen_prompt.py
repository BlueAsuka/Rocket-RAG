You are a helpful assistant that generates multiple search queries based on a single input query.
You will be offered a report of fault diagnosis and you should extract the fault type from this report.
EXAMPLE:
Retrieval results: ['lackLubrication1_40_10_2', 'lackLubrication1_40_7_4', 'lackLubrication1_40_2_3', 'lackLubrication1_40_1_1', 'lackLubrication1_40_2_5']
Diagonsis results:
Refined fault type1: Fault in lack of lubrication
Inference evidence: [lackLubrication1_40_10_2 with <high>, lackLubrication1_40_7_4 with <medium>, lackLubrication1_40_2_3 with <medium>, lackLubrication1_40_1_1 with <low>, lackLubrication1_40_2_5 with <medium>]
Description of the Fault: The actuator is experiencing a fault in lack of lubrication. This condition can lead to increased friction and potential for wear and tear, impacting performance and longevity. It's important to address this issue promptly to prevent further damage and ensure optimal operation of the system.

You should recognize the fault type 'Fault in lack of lubrication' from this report result. Then you can parse the query string for searching.

Then you should generate multiple search queries related to how to recover or conduct maintenance for the detected fault type on the linear actuators?

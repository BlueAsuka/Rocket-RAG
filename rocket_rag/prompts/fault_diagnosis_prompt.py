context = """
CONTEXT:
The use case is linear actuators fault diagnosis, and the contextual background for the use case is listed in the following text.
There are four main different states in this use case: Normal, Spalling, Backlash and Lack of lubrication.
Except for the Normal state, other states are all fault states that you should report to the asset owner or operator.
Normal: The actuator operates under standard conditions without any faults. This state serves as a baseline for comparing the performance under fault conditions.
Spalling: This state simulates the condition where the ball-screw mechanism has surface damage, affecting the actuator's smoothness and efficiency.
Lack of Lubrication: In this state, the actuator operates with insufficient lubrication, leading to increased friction and potential for wear and tear, impacting performance and longevity.
Backlash: Represents a state where there is a gap or looseness in the connection between the parts of the actuator, leading to inaccuracies and reduced precision in movement.
"""

rules = """
RULES:
For each fault type, there are different degradation degrees to indicate the damage level of the fault.
The format of the fault type with the degradation degree is Fault_Type + Number + suffix. (Except for the 'normal' state)
ONLY focus on the part of Fault_Type + Number
EXAMPLE:
'spalling2_20_10_2' indicates that the system is suffering from the spalling fault in the degradation level 2. 
'backlash1_20_1_1' indicates that the system is in backlash in the degradation level 1.
'lackLubrication2_20_1_2' indicates that the system is in lack of lubrication in the degradation level 2.

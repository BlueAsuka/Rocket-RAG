Introduction \\nThe dataset presented here was acquired for the study of degradation in linear \\nactuators, particularly electro-mechanical actuators (EMA). The data was acquired \\nfrom an instrumented rig (described in section 2) where a ball-screw actuator moved \\nleft to right following a defined motion profile with a level of load selected by the user. Nut position and motor current measurements were acquired during the tests. Initially the rig was tested in normal conditions (absence of faults) under different \\nmotion and loading scenarios. Subsequently different mechanical faults, including lack \\nof lubrication, spalling and backlash, were seeded in the system. Position and motor \\ncurrent data were acquired under these conditions to study monitoring methods to \\ndetect faults and degradation in this particular type of systems. This document describes in detail the data files available in the repository.',\n",
       " 'Section 2 \\nshows the experimental set up. Section three describes the different cases studied \\nand finally the data structure is explained in section 4.',\n",
       " '2. Experimental set up \\nA ball-screw mechanism where threaded shaft provides a helical raceway for ball \\nbearings housed inside a nut was selected for this study. This arrangement allows the \\ntransformation of shaft rotation into nut linear displacement with little friction and high \\nprecision. In order to simulate varying loading scenarios that represent realistic \\noperating conditions, a second actuator was used.',\n",
       " 'Both actuators were connected \\nthrough a load cell, and the load measurements provided were fed back to the \\ncontroller of the second actuator. Using this configuration it is possible to send a load \\nset point command to the second actuator and take control of the external load in the \\nactuator being tested. Ball-screws with fitted anti backlash ball-nut model RM1605-C7 with 5 mm lead and \\nNema 34 stepper motors with 4.6 Nm holding torque were selected. The mechanical \\ncomponents were mounted on an aluminium profile structure.',\n",
       " 'The motors of both \\nactuators were controlled from a Labview interface, which was also responsible for the \\ndata collection. The rig was instrumented with a series of sensors for control and monitoring purposes. Position was measured with a Vishay REC 115L linear potentiometer. Current from \\nthe drive is measured by a Honeywell CSLA2CD Hall effect sensor. The load between \\nboth actuators was measured using a Tedea Huntleigh, S beam type model 614 load \\ncell. Load measurements were used only for controlling the load provided by the \\nsecond actuator, but never for monitoring purposes. All the data was acquired at 25 \\nHz.',\n",

       " 'These two motion profiles were \\ntested for normal and faulty conditions under three different loading scenarios: 20 kgf, \\n40 kgf and -40 kgf. The full motion sequence was repeated 5 times in each test, and \\neach test was repeated 10 times in order to generate a dataset with a significant \\namount of observation in each case studied. In every test, before the data collection \\nstarted, the rig was run for about 30 mins until a steady temperature was reached in \\nthe motors and the nut. Additionally, three different mechanical faults were introduced in various parts of the \\nsystem. Tests were run on the faulty system using the same motion profiles and \\nloading conditions used under normal operation. The faults introduced were selected \\nto be representative of critical failure modes of this type of machine. The faults tested \\nwere: \\n\\uf0b7 lack of lubrication: simulated by removing gradually the screw lubricant and \\ntightening the nut seals (Fig. 3); \\n\\uf0b7 spalling: simulated by artificially inducing surface defects of different sizes in \\nthe screw and balls (Fig. 4) \\n\\uf0b7 backlash: simulated by replacing the original balls with balls of smaller \\ndiameter (Fig. 5).',\n",
       " 'Seeded faults were introduced because there was insufficient test time to run the ball \\nscrews naturally to failure. The faults were introduced gradually in order to observe \\nhow the severity of the faults affect the measured signals. In the case of lack of lubrication, in the first stage the lubricant was removed with \\ndegreaser. No dramatic changes were observed in the signals, mainly due to the \\ninherent low friction of the ball-screw architecture.

Introduction \\nThe dataset presented here was acquired for the study of degradation in linear \\nactuators, particularly electro-mechanical actuators (EMA). The data was acquired \\nfrom an instrumented rig (described in section 2) where a ball-screw actuator moved \\nleft to right following a defined motion profile with a level of load selected by the user. \\nNut position and motor current measurements were acquired during the tests. \\n \\nInitially the rig was tested in normal conditions (absence of faults) under different \\nmotion and loading scenarios. Subsequently different mechanical faults, including lack \\nof lubrication, spalling and backlash, were seeded in the system. Position and motor \\ncurrent data were acquired under these conditions to study monitoring methods to \\ndetect faults and degradation in this particular type of systems. \\n \\nThis document describes in detail the data files available in the repository. Section 2 \\nshows the experimental set up. Section three describes the different cases studied \\nand finally the data structure is explained in section 4. \\n \\n \\n2. Experimental set up \\nA ball-screw mechanism where threaded shaft provides a helical raceway for ball \\nbearings housed inside a nut was selected for this study. This arrangement allows the \\ntransformation of shaft rotation into nut linear displacement with little friction and high \\nprecision. In order to simulate varying loading scenarios that represent realistic \\noperating conditions, a second actuator was used. Both actuators were connected \\nthrough a load cell, and the load measurements provided were fed back to the \\ncontroller of the second actuator. Using this configuration it is possible to send a load \\nset point command to the second actuator and take control of the external load in the \\nactuator being tested.  \\n \\nBall-screws with fitted anti backlash ball-nut model RM1605-C7 with 5 mm lead and \\nNema 34 stepper motors with 4.6 Nm holding torque were selected. The mechanical \\ncomponents were mounted on an aluminium profile structure. The motors of both \\nactuators were controlled from a Labview interface, which was also responsible for the \\ndata collection.   \\n \\nThe rig was instrumented with a series of sensors for control and monitoring purposes. \\nPosition was measured with a Vishay REC 115L linear potentiometer. Current from \\nthe drive is measured by a Honeywell CSLA2CD Hall effect sensor. The load between \\nboth actuators was measured using a Tedea Huntleigh, S beam type model 614 load \\ncell.

INTRODUCTION\\nL\\nINEAR machines are all around us, covering a wide\\nrange of applications such as aircraft undercarriage and\\ncontrol surfaces, automatic doors, railway track point and level\\ncrossing actuators, robot arms, CNC machine tools, and many\\nmore. A failure in these actuators can be critical for the safety,\\nperformance, and availability of the system in which they are\\nintegrated. In some cases, such as the operation of control\\nsurfaces in aircrafts, a fault in an actuator can also compromise\\nthe safety of passengers and crew. That was the case of the\\nAlaska Airlines 261 ﬂight accident in 2000, where an excess\\nof wear in the jackscrew actuator that controls the horizontal\\nstabilizer of the plane caused the crash of the aircraft, and\\nthe death of 88 people [1]. This clearly demonstrates the\\nimportance of monitoring the health of linear actuators.\\nMany different types of linear actuators are available com-\\nmercially.

More recently, electro-mechanical\\nactuators (EMAs) based on the combination of an electric\\nmotor and a screw, belt and pulley, or rack and pinion\\nmechanisms have gained popularity due to their automation\\nand control capabilities, in addition to other beneﬁts such\\nas simplicity or weight reduction. The failure modes and\\ndegradation in this type of devices have not been studied in\\ndepth yet, but a comprehensive list of typical failure modes and\\na criticality analysis for ball-screw mechanisms was provided\\nin [2]. Structural failures such as excess of wear, cracking,\\nbacklash, or spalling; malfunctions such as ball return channel\\njamming or seizure; and lubricant-related faults such as run-\\ndry or contamination are amongst the most severe and common\\nmechanical faults in this type of mechanism.\\nDespite the increasing utilization of linear actuators and the\\ncritical role played in some of their applications, the presence\\nof condition monitoring tools for these devices is quite limited\\nin industrial applications and academic research. This fact can\\nbe attributed to several different causes as follows.\\n1) The use of condition monitoring tools is typically limited\\nto high-value assets.\\n2) There are a large number of different typologies of linear\\nactuators, leading to the need for speciﬁc tools for each\\ntype.\\n3) The different assemblies use components of different\\nnature and often require specialist knowledge about\\nmechanical, electrical, and control interfaces, creating\\nchallenges to assemble the skill set.\\n4) Complex dynamics including nonlinearities, changing\\noperational conditions, dominance of friction phenom-\\nena, and nonstationary operation create a challenging\\nstarting point for the design of monitoring tools.\\nThe presence of sensors in linear actuators is typically\\nlimited to system control purposes, which is also a constraint\\nfor the implementation of condition monitoring strategies.\\nDespite all these difﬁculties, some research work has been\\ndone recently in industry and academia, particularly for linear\\nEMAs. The potential application of EMAs in the more and\\nall electric aircraft for operation of control surfaces and the\\nlanding gear [3], and the monitoring systems required, are\\nprobably the main research topics [4]. For this application,\\nas the actuator is installed in an aircraft, the reliability of\\nany new system needs to be auditable and related to known\\ndata [5], and be at least as good as conventional hydraulic\\nsystems.

The monitoring approaches developed in the\\npast normally relied on mathematical models of the actu-\\nator [7]–[15] based on ﬁrst principles. Despite the success\\nof these approaches, the need of unique models limits its\\napplication to a speciﬁc machine and requires a specialist\\nmodeler. Other approaches used the measurements of signals\\nthat normally are not available in industrial applications such\\nas temperature or vibration [16]–[18], requiring the installation\\nof additional sensors and wiring.\\nThis paper presents a monitoring technique that can be\\napplied to different types of EMA, making use of signals avail-\\nable from the controller or the motor drive to detect mechanical\\nfaults. Electric fault in motors is a widely studied subject [19]\\nand it is not covered here. This research explores a monitoring\\nmethod based on the automated extraction and the analysis\\nof signal features such as steady value, overshoot, settling\\ntime, or presence of unexpected peaks. These features char-\\nacterize the dynamic behavior of the system. Consequently,\\nany signiﬁcant change in the condition of the system will\\nhave an effect over these signal features. Principal component\\nanalysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of the\\nextracted feature set and detect any deviations from normal\\nbehavior. The independence from a need for a physical model,\\nthe low computation time, and the use of current and position\\nmeasurements exclusively are the main advantages of this\\napproach.\\nThe capabilities of the proposed method are tested and\\nassessed using experimental data. A special ball-screw test\\nrig was designed to recreate fault scenarios under different\\noperating conditions, such as different motion proﬁles, varying\\nspeeds, or different loadings. This rig is also capable of a\\nrack and pinion arrangement, not further considered here.\\nDuring the experiments, different motion proﬁles and loading\\nconditions were tested to evaluate the performance of the\\nmonitoring algorithm under various operating conditions. The\\nraw data used in this investigation is available to download\\nat [20].\\nII. METHODOLOGY\\nMechanical faults such as those mentioned in Section I\\nmay affect the operation of the mechanism and degrade its\\nperformance. If this degradation is considerable, it may have\\nan impact on the actuator behavior which potentially can be\\nobserved in variables measured such as the current being\\nfed to the motor or the motion proﬁle. Nevertheless, for this\\nparticular application the mechanism motion is not stationary,\\nas it accelerates and decelerates in every movement repetition\\nfrom one position to another. Additionally, different motion\\nproﬁles and different loading conditions may produce different\\nmeasured values even in the absence of faults, which compli-\\ncates the monitoring task. However, there are certain features\\nin those signals that are deﬁned by the dynamic behavior of the\\nsystem and the controller, such as steady values during steady-\\nstate operation, overshoots and subsequent oscillations after a\\nchange in the position set point, and so on. A change in these\\nFig. 1.\\nPosition measurements.\\nfeatures may be indicative of changes in the system behavior,\\nwhich can be related to faults or malfunctions. An initial\\nstudy of the main features observed in current and position\\nmeasurements measured in EMA based on computational\\nsimulations was presented in [21].\\nThe monitoring approach presented in this paper is based on\\nthe analysis of the correlation between different characteristic\\nfeatures extracted from current and position measurements\\nusing PCA. The objective of that analysis is to deﬁne the\\nnormal dynamic behavior of the system by analyzing key\\nsignal features under different operating conditions in the\\nabsence of faults, and then look for deviations from that\\nnormal behavior in order to detect and diagnose faults. The\\napplication of this approach consists of two major steps: ﬁrst,\\nthe extraction of key features from the signals that deﬁne the\\ndynamic behavior of the system, and second, the correlation\\nanalysis using PCA.\\nA. Feature Extraction\\nFig. 1 shows an example of ideal (noise free) position\\nmeasurements for a “trapezoidal motion proﬁle” moving at\\na constant speed to a stroke of 50 mm, before returning\\nto its starting point. The set point illustrated is very close\\nto the actual position. A zoomed-in version of the position\\nerror, calculated as the difference between the actual position\\nmeasurement and the desired set point, is represented in\\ngreen. This ﬁgure shows that the actuator is able to follow\\naccurately the desired motion proﬁle. However, the zoomed-\\nin position error signal reveals some interesting features in\\neach of the motion sections. A steady value (feature a) close\\nto zero is achieved during the major part of the movement.\\nThis movement starts with an overshoot (feature b) and some\\noscillations in the signal during the settling time (feature c)\\nbefore the steady value is reached. In addition, unexpected\\npeaks (feature d) may also be visible in the steady region due\\nto noise, external disturbances, or malfunctions in the system.\\nFinally, the standard deviation (Std) during the steady region\\n(feature e) can also be extracted. These features have been\\nhighlighted in Fig. 1 only for the second stage of the movement\\n(retraction), but the same features were also extracted also for\\nthe ﬁrst movement (extension).\\nThe characteristics of the current signal (Fig. 2) are very\\nsimilar to the position error, and the same features can be\\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Cranfield University.

Principal Component Analysis of Selected Features\\nPCA can characterize the state of a process by projecting\\nthe acquired data into a lower-dimensional space. This method\\nhas been used in many previous research works to decrease\\ndata redundancy [22] and select the most relevant features [23].\\nThis dimensionality reduction technique preserves the correla-\\ntion between the measurements capturing the data variability\\nin an optimal way [24]. Given an n × m data set matrix X\\ncontaining n observations and m variables, it is possible to\\nobtain a set of loading vectors V by solving the eigenvalue\\ndecomposition of the covariance matrix S\\nS =\\n1\\nn −1 XT X = V \\x02V T\\n(1)\\nwhere the loading vectors V are ordered by the amount of\\nvariance expressed by the corresponding eigenvalue in the\\ndiagonal matrix \\x02. The loading vectors attached to the a\\nlargest singular values are retained in the loading matrix\\nR ∈Rm×a. This set of vectors generates a lower dimensional\\nrepresentation of the extracted features. The projection of the\\ndata into this reduced space captures systematic trends of the\\ndata, reducing the amount of random noise [24] by minimizing\\nthe negative effects of measurement inaccuracies. The score\\nmatrix W contains the projection of the observed data into\\nthe lower dimensional space, while the residual matrix E\\nrepresents the difference between the observations and the\\nprojection of W back into the m-dimensional space\\nW = X R\\n(2)\\nE = X −W RT .\\n(3)\\nThe indicators most commonly used for the detection of\\nfaults are the Hotelling T 2 indicator (which represents major\\nvariations in the retained space) and the squared prediction\\nerror Q (representing variations in the residual space) [24].\\nThese indicators can be computed for each observation x as\\nfollows:\\nT 2 = yT y\\n(4)\\nQ = xT (I −RRT )x\\n(5)\\nwhere I is the identity matrix and the principal components\\n(PCs) y = \\x02a 1/2W T x have been rescaled to have unit\\nvariance [24].\\nThe upper control limits (UCL) for T 2 and Q can be\\ncalculated for a given signiﬁcance level α such that P(T 2 <\\nT 2\\nUCL(α)) = α and P(Q < QUCL(α)) = α, respectively.\\nThese control limits are estimated during the training phase\\nusing data acquired in the absence of faults. Later, in the\\nmonitoring phase, the values of T 2 and Q obtained are\\ncompared with these UCL to differentiate between normal and\\nfaulty behaviors. Usually, these control limits are calculated\\nassuming that the measurements are normally distributed.\\nHowever, this is not the case for nonlinear systems, which\\nmakes this assumption invalid. Odiowei and Cao [25] devel-\\noped a methodology to solve this issue by estimating the actual\\nprobability density function of the statistical indicators using\\nkernel density estimations (KDEs). The effectiveness of this\\napproach has also been tested using experimental data [26].The\\nprobability of a random variable x [with a probability density\\nfunction p(x)] to be smaller than a certain value s is deﬁned\\nas\\nP(x < s) =\\n\\x02 s\\n−∞\\np(x)dx\\n(6)\\nwhere p(x) can be calculated through the kernel function K\\nwith argument g\\np(x) = 1\\nnh\\nn\\n\\x03\\nk=1\\nK\\n\\x04x −xk\\nh\\n\\x05\\n(7)\\nK(g) = e\\n−g2\\n2\\n\\x06 √\\n2π\\n(8)\\nwhere h is the selected bandwidth [25] and xk is the kth sample\\nof x. By replacing xk with T 2\\nk and Qk obtained from (4)\\nand (5), respectively, it is possible to estimate the probability\\ndensity function of T 2 and Q. The respective control limits\\nfor these statistics correspond to s in (6), obtained by solving\\nP(x < s) = α. The value of the parameter α is critical for the\\ndiagnosis performance, and it is chosen by the user to balance\\nthe detection sensitivity and false alarm rate.\\nIII. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\\nA.

Different typical faults were seeded in this rig under\\ndifferent loading conditions in order to study how these\\nfaults affect the measurements acquired from the system and\\nhow these signals can be processed for fault detection and\\ndiagnosis.\\nIn order to simulate varying loading scenarios that represent\\nrealistic operating conditions, a second actuator was used.\\nBoth actuators were connected through a load cell, and the\\nload measurements provided were fed back to the controller\\nof the second actuator. Using this conﬁguration, it is possible\\nto send a load set point command to the second actuator and\\ntake control of the external load in the actuator being tested.\\nHowever, loading measurements were not used for monitoring,\\nas in real applications they are rarely available. The proposed\\nmonitoring system must be able to cope with varying loads\\nwithout using load measurements.\\nThe test rig was designed using components available in the\\nmarket for the construction of small CNC machines such as\\nball-screw arrangements, linear guides and bearings, stepper\\nmotors, drives, and so on. Ball-screws with ﬁtted antibacklash\\nball-nut model RM1605-C7 with 5-mm lead and Nema 34\\nstepper motors with 4.6-Nm holding torque were selected. The\\nmechanical components were mounted on an aluminum proﬁle\\nstructure. The motors of both actuators were controlled from\\na LabView interface, which was also responsible for the data\\ncollection.\\nThe rig was instrumented with a series of sensors for\\ncontrol and monitoring purposes. For the fault detection to\\nbe effective, the sensors used need to be accurate enough in\\nterms of resolution, bandwidth, and repeatability to capture\\nthe features introduced in Section II-A adequately. Position\\nwas measured with a Vishay REC 115L linear potentiome-\\nter, which has a linearity error of ±0.025% and repeata-\\nbility of ±0.01%. Current from the drive is measured by\\na Honeywell CSLA2CD Hall effect sensor with a nominal\\nsensitivity of 32.7 mV per cable turn (10 turns). In addi-\\ntion, for further research, nut and motor temperatures were\\nmeasured using K-type thermocouples, and vibration in the\\nnut was measured by a Dytran 3055D2 accelerometer. The\\nload between both actuators was measured using a Tedea\\nHuntleigh, S beam-type model 614 load cell (total error\\n0.02%). Load measurements were used only for controlling\\nthe load provided by the second actuator, but never for\\nmonitoring purposes. All the data were acquired at 25 Hz,\\nexcept for vibration measurements acquired at 50 kHz. The\\nsampling rate selection was based upon a preliminary analysis\\nof the signals acquired at a much higher frequency (500 Hz),\\nwhere it was observed that the dynamic features described in\\nSection II-A are relatively slow and can be captured accurately\\nat 25 Hz.\\nThis rig design is capable of producing a displacement\\nof 120 mm with a maximum external load of 392.3 N in both\\ndirections. The approximate dimensions of the complete rig\\nare 0.75 m long, 0.35 m wide, and 0.25 m high.

Cases Studied\\nInitially, the rig was run under normal operating conditions\\n(absence of faults) in order to collect a signiﬁcant amount\\nof data that can represent the behavior of the system under\\ndifferent loading conditions and motion proﬁles. Then different\\nfaults were introduced in different parts of the system, and the\\nsignals collected were used to assess the monitoring technique\\nand study the degradation of the actuator. The faults introduced\\nare selected to be representative of critical failure modes of\\nthis type of machine [2].

The faults\\nwere introduced gradually in order to observe how the severity\\nof the faults affects the features extracted from the signals\\nand assess the detection capabilities of the algorithm. In the\\ncase of lack of lubrication, in the ﬁrst stage the lubricant was\\nremoved with degreaser. No dramatic changes were observed\\nin the signals, mainly due to the inherent low friction of the\\nball-screw architecture. In order to increase the severity of\\nthe fault, the bolts holding the plastic seal at both ends of\\nthe nut containing the balls were tightened, to create more\\nfriction (see Fig. 5). The spalling defect was started as a\\n1-mm diameter surface defect on the rolling surface of the\\nscrew (see Fig. 6). In the following second, third, and fourth\\nstages, the size of the defect was gradually increased to 2, 3,\\nand 4 mm in diameter, affecting not only the bottom of the\\nchannel but also one of the sides. In stage 5, the 4-mm\\ndefect was replicated in a neighbor channel, and in stage 6,\\nthe size of both defects was increased affecting the sidewall\\nbetween them. In stage 7, another 4-mm defect was seeded\\non the other neighbor channel of the original defect. Finally,\\nin stage 8 part of the sidewall between two of the defects was\\npartially removed (see Fig. 6). Backlash or excess of play was\\nsimulated replacing the original 3.15-mm diameter balls by\\n3- and 2.5-mm diameter balls (see Fig. 7).\\nThe tests were performed for different motion proﬁles and\\nloading conditions in order to assess the capabilities of the\\nalgorithm under different scenarios. Two motion proﬁles were\\ntested. The ﬁrst was a trapezoidal motion proﬁle (constant\\nspeed set point) where the 120-mm stroke was completed in\\n5 s with 3 s waiting at both ends of the movement. The second\\nwas a sinusoidal motion proﬁle (smooth speed transition) with\\n120-mm stroke completed in 6 s with 2 s waiting at both ends.\\nThese two motion proﬁles were tested for normal and faulty\\nconditions under three different loading scenarios: 196.13,\\n392.3, and −392.3 N. The full motion sequence was repeated\\nﬁve times in each test, and each test was repeated 10 times\\nin order to generate a data set with a signiﬁcant amount of\\nobservation in each case studied. In every test, before the data\\ncollection started, the rig was run for about 30 min until a\\nsteady temperature was reached in the motors and the nut.\\nIV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\\nA. Feature Extraction\\nAs mentioned in Section II-A, the extraction of features\\nfrom the signal is critical for the performance of the\\nmonitoring algorithm. For that reason, the features set were\\nchosen for likely sensitivity to degradation, and then tested\\nfor effectiveness. The correlation between these features was\\nstudied using PCA in order to establish a baseline that deﬁnes\\nthe normal behavior of the system in the absence of faults\\nunder different loading scenarios. As an additional beneﬁt, this\\nprocedure signiﬁcantly reduces the amount of data analyzed.\\nDuring the training phase, using data acquired in the absence\\nof faults, these features were combined to capture the system\\ndynamics under different operating scenarios. In subsequent\\ntests, any deviations found in these features were examined\\nfor indication of the presence of faults in the system.\\nDue to the differences in the signals acquired for trapezoidal\\nand sinusoidal motion proﬁles, the sets of features extracted\\nand the extraction method in each case are slightly different.\\nThese features were extracted from position error and current\\nsignals independently for the extension and retraction move-\\nment in each complete motion, and each motion type was\\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Cranfield University.

This ﬁltering process produces a smoothed signal\\neliminating random noise that allows for a more accurate\\nestimation of the settling time (see Fig. 9). The settling time\\nwas established as the last data point in the ﬁltered signal\\nwith an absolute value lower than 0.5 mm for position error\\nand lower than 10% of the mean steady current for the\\ncurrent signal. These threshold values were set empirically\\nTABLE I\\nFEATURES STRUCTURE FOR TRAPEZOIDAL PROFILE\\n(FEATURES FROM SECTION II-A)\\nafter analyzing the behavior of the signals under different\\noperating conditions. Finally, the amplitude of the maximum\\ndeviation with respect to the mean steady value and the\\nstandard deviation between the settling time and the end of\\nthe movement was computed for both signals. An example\\nof features captured can be seen in Fig. 9(a). Table I shows\\nthe ﬁnal list of features extracted from both signals for the\\ntrapezoidal case and the ID number assigned to each of these\\nfeatures, which will be referred to in Section IV.\\nIn the case of the sinusoidal proﬁle, due to the constant\\nchange in the speed set point, none of the signals ever reached\\na real “steady value.” In the case of the position error, only\\nthe overshoot value was captured. For current measurements,\\nin addition to the overshoot, a region around the maximum\\nspeed point with a speed variation lower than 10% was further\\nanalyzed. The current signal was considered almost steady in\\nthis region, and the mean value, the amplitude of the maximum\\ndeviation from the mean, and the standard deviation were\\nextracted from this signal section.

That is why, it is necessary to produce\\na condition indicator that can characterize the health of the\\nsystem under varying operating conditions for this application.\\nThe training data set was composed of 150 observations\\n(50 for each loading condition tested) and 20 measure-\\nments were analyzed following the procedure described in\\nSection II-B. The number of PCs to retain a was chosen so that\\nat least 80% of the variability in the data is retained. According\\nto the analysis of the singular values, the number of retained\\nPCs was set to 2. The probability density function of the T 2\\nand Q indicators was estimated using KDE. The thresholds\\nwere calculated for a conﬁdence bound of 90%, obtaining\\nvalues of 17.88 and 18.89 for T 2 and Q, respectively.\\nFig. 11(a) shows the values of both indicators against their\\nrespective thresholds for the three loading scenarios in the\\nabsence of faults. This result shows the ability of PCA to\\nprovide information about the system condition for different\\noperating conditions. Fig. 11(b) shows the scores for the two\\nmain PCs, which is a measurement of the weight of each\\nfeature measured in each dimension of the PC space.\\nThe same analysis was undertaken for the sinusoidal proﬁle\\ndata set. In this case also, two PCs were retained and the\\nthreshold values were set to 13.75 and 5.85 for the T 2 and\\nQ indicators, respectively. Fig. 12 summarizes the results\\nobtained in this case.\\n2) Lack of Lubrication: This case was studied in two stages\\nwith increasing severity. Fig. 13(a) shows the condition indi-\\ncators for this case for the trapezoidal proﬁle, where the ﬁrst\\n150 samples correspond to the ﬁrst stage and the remaining\\n150 observations correspond to the second stage. The detection\\nrate for the T 2 indicator was 48.6% and 64.7% for the ﬁrst\\nand second stages of the test, respectively. The Q indicator\\nshowed a better performance with 88% and 100% detection\\nrate for the ﬁrst and second stages. Different values of number\\nof PCs retained a were tried to improve the performance of\\nthe T 2 indicator, obtaining poorer results. As a consequence,\\nthis parameter was kept to 2. The lack of detection of the T 2\\nindicator is attributed to the fact that this particular fault tends\\nto produce features located away from the retained PCs rather\\nthan changing the values of the features within the retained\\nspace.\\nFig. 13(b) shows an example the contribution of each mea-\\nsurement to each indicator at sample number 15 (ﬁrst stage,\\n196.13 N.

CONCLUSION\\nThis paper presents a novel method for linear actuator\\nmonitoring based on extraction of key features from cur-\\nrent and position measurements. These features are carefully\\nselected in order to obtain a good representation of the system\\ndynamics during transient and steady operation with a reduced\\ndata set. These features are combined using PCA to produce\\ncondition indicators that can be used for fault detection, as\\nthey are able to indicate changes in the system dynamics even\\nunder different operating conditions such as different loading\\nscenarios. In addition, the capabilities of PCA to eliminate\\nrandom variations in the data and capture systematic trends\\nhelped to reduce background noise in the signals.\\nThe proposed approach was tested using experimental data\\nacquired from a rig designed to operate under different\\nloading conditions and allowing faults to be seeded.

In particular, the Q indicator showed a\\nlow false alarm rate, and the Q contribution plots provided\\nvaluable information for fault diagnosis. The T 2 indicator,\\non the other hand, typically showed low detection rates, despite\\nthe efforts made in tuning the algorithm parameters to improve\\nits performance. Both indicators failed to detect spalling in\\nthe ﬁrst stages of degradation, but during the tests it was\\nobserved that the mechanism performance and behavior was\\nnot very different from what was observed in the absence of\\nfaults. When the defect introduced was big enough to affect\\nthe behavior of the mechanism considerably, the algorithm\\nwas able to detect the fault and provide information about its\\norigin. The use of multivariate analysis was crucial to simplify\\nthe fault detection and diagnosis problem involving several\\nvariables and changing operation.\\nThe superior performance of the Q indicator over T 2 has\\nalso been observed in other investigations. Generally, it is\\nattributed to the fact that most faults tend to produce features\\nlocated away from the retained PCs rather than changing the\\nvalues of the features within the retained space. Although\\ndifferent tests were carried out retaining a higher number of\\nprincipal components, the best overall detection performance\\nwas found setting this parameter to 2.\\nThe analysis of the contribution of each measurement to\\nthe indicators’ value provided very useful information about\\nthe origin of the source of the threshold crossing. Some\\nof the selected features produced signiﬁcantly high scores\\nduring the training phase, as they contain most of the data\\nvariability in such conditions. However, some of the features\\nwith lower scores were determinant in the detection of some\\nfaults, proving the need to include such features to provide\\naccurate diagnosis information. This information could be used\\nnot only to detect the fault automatically but also to guide\\nsubsequent inspection to conﬁrm the origin and extent of the\\nfault, which some industries may require before commission-\\ning replacement or repair. In order to improve the perfor-\\nmance of the proposed approach in the future investigations,\\nthe exploration of indicator combination and the comparison\\nof measurements with historic data and previous operations\\nfor building conﬁdence in diagnosis is suggested.\\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\\nThe authors would like to thank the Engineering and Phys-\\nical Sciences Research Council Centre for Through-life Engi-\\nneering Services, Rolls-Royce, BAE Systems, Bombardier\\nTransportation, Babcock, and the Ministry of Defence.\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] The\\nNational\\nTransportation\\nSafety\\nBoard.\\nAviation\\nAccident\\nReport—Loss of Control and Impact with Paciﬁc Ocean, Alaska\\nAirlines\\nFlight\\n261,\\nMcDonnell\\nDouglas\\nMD-83,\\nN963AS,\\nAbout 2.7 Miles North of Anacapa Island, California.

As a consequence, actuators are required to perform a\\nwide variety of tasks, often for linear motion. However, the use\\nof tools to monitor the condition of linear actuators is not widely\\nextended in industrial applications. This paper presents a data-\\nbased method to monitor linear electro-mechanical actuators. The proposed algorithm makes use of features extracted from\\nelectric current and position measurements, typically available\\nfrom the controller, to detect and diagnose mechanical faults. The\\nfeatures are selected to characterize the system dynamics during\\ntransient and steady-state operation and are then combined\\nto produce a condition indicator. The main advantage of this\\napproach is the independence from a need for a physical\\nmodel or additional sensors. The capabilities of the method\\nare assessed using a novel experimental linear actuator test rig\\nspecially designed to recreate fault scenarios under different\\noperating conditions.

More recently, electro-mechanical\\nactuators (EMAs) based on the combination of an electric\\nmotor and a screw, belt and pulley, or rack and pinion\\nmechanisms have gained popularity due to their automation\\nand control capabilities, in addition to other beneﬁts such\\nas simplicity or weight reduction. The failure modes and\\ndegradation in this type of devices have not been studied in\\ndepth yet, but a comprehensive list of typical failure modes and\\na criticality analysis for ball-screw mechanisms was provided\\nin [2]. Structural failures such as excess of wear, cracking,\\nbacklash, or spalling; malfunctions such as ball return channel\\njamming or seizure; and lubricant-related faults such as run-\\ndry or contamination are amongst the most severe and common\\nmechanical faults in this type of mechanism. Despite the increasing utilization of linear actuators and the\\ncritical role played in some of their applications, the presence\\nof condition monitoring tools for these devices is quite limited\\nin industrial applications and academic research. This fact can\\nbe attributed to several different causes as follows. 1) The use of condition monitoring tools is typically limited\\nto high-value assets. 2) There are a large number of different typologies of linear\\nactuators, leading to the need for speciﬁc tools for each\\ntype. 3) The different assemblies use components of different\\nnature and often require specialist knowledge about\\nmechanical, electrical, and control interfaces, creating\\nchallenges to assemble the skill set. 4) Complex dynamics including nonlinearities, changing\\noperational conditions, dominance of friction phenom-\\nena, and nonstationary operation create a challenging\\nstarting point for the design of monitoring tools. The presence of sensors in linear actuators is typically\\nlimited to system control purposes, which is also a constraint\\nfor the implementation of condition monitoring strategies. Despite all these difﬁculties, some research work has been\\ndone recently in industry and academia, particularly for linear\\nEMAs. The potential application of EMAs in the more and\\nall electric aircraft for operation of control surfaces and the\\nlanding gear [3], and the monitoring systems required, are\\nprobably the main research topics [4].

The motors of both actuators were controlled from\\na LabView interface, which was also responsible for the data\\ncollection. The rig was instrumented with a series of sensors for\\ncontrol and monitoring purposes. For the fault detection to\\nbe effective, the sensors used need to be accurate enough in\\nterms of resolution, bandwidth, and repeatability to capture\\nthe features introduced in Section II-A adequately.

Current from the drive is measured by\\na Honeywell CSLA2CD Hall effect sensor with a nominal\\nsensitivity of 32.7 mV per cable turn (10 turns). In addi-\\ntion, for further research, nut and motor temperatures were\\nmeasured using K-type thermocouples, and vibration in the\\nnut was measured by a Dytran 3055D2 accelerometer. The\\nload between both actuators was measured using a Tedea\\nHuntleigh, S beam-type model 614 load cell (total error\\n0.02%).

       " 'RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\\nA. Feature Extraction\\nAs mentioned in Section II-A, the extraction of features\\nfrom the signal is critical for the performance of the\\nmonitoring algorithm. For that reason, the features set were\\nchosen for likely sensitivity to degradation, and then tested\\nfor effectiveness. The correlation between these features was\\nstudied using PCA in order to establish a baseline that deﬁnes\\nthe normal behavior of the system in the absence of faults\\nunder different loading scenarios. As an additional beneﬁt, this\\nprocedure signiﬁcantly reduces the amount of data analyzed. During the training phase, using data acquired in the absence\\nof faults, these features were combined to capture the system\\ndynamics under different operating scenarios. In subsequent\\ntests, any deviations found in these features were examined\\nfor indication of the presence of faults in the system. Due to the differences in the signals acquired for trapezoidal\\nand sinusoidal motion proﬁles, the sets of features extracted\\nand the extraction method in each case are slightly different.

These features are carefully\\nselected in order to obtain a good representation of the system\\ndynamics during transient and steady operation with a reduced\\ndata set. These features are combined using PCA to produce\\ncondition indicators that can be used for fault detection, as\\nthey are able to indicate changes in the system dynamics even\\nunder different operating conditions such as different loading\\nscenarios. In addition, the capabilities of PCA to eliminate\\nrandom variations in the data and capture systematic trends\\nhelped to reduce background noise in the signals. The proposed approach was tested using experimental data\\nacquired from a rig designed to operate under different\\nloading conditions and allowing faults to be seeded. Data\\nwere acquired from position and current measurements under\\nnormal conditions, with lack of lubrication, spalling, and with\\nworn balls to simulate backlash. The sensors characteristics\\nwere selected to provide accurate and reliable measurements\\nable to represent the characteristics of the system dynam-\\nics.

The results obtained showed that the proposed feature\\nextraction and analysis approach was able to effectively detect\\nthe lack of lubrication and backlash under different motion and\\nloading conditions. In particular, the Q indicator showed a\\nlow false alarm rate, and the Q contribution plots provided\\nvaluable information for fault diagnosis. The T 2 indicator,\\non the other hand, typically showed low detection rates, despite\\nthe efforts made in tuning the algorithm parameters to improve\\nits performance. Both indicators failed to detect spalling in\\nthe ﬁrst stages of degradation, but during the tests it was\\nobserved that the mechanism performance and behavior was\\nnot very different from what was observed in the absence of\\nfaults. When the defect introduced was big enough to affect\\nthe behavior of the mechanism considerably, the algorithm\\nwas able to detect the fault and provide information about its\\norigin. The use of multivariate analysis was crucial to simplify\\nthe fault detection and diagnosis problem involving several\\nvariables and changing operation. The superior performance of the Q indicator over T 2 has\\nalso been observed in other investigations. Generally, it is\\nattributed to the fact that most faults tend to produce features\\nlocated away from the retained PCs rather than changing the\\nvalues of the features within the retained space. Although\\ndifferent tests were carried out retaining a higher number of\\nprincipal components, the best overall detection performance\\nwas found setting this parameter to 2. The analysis of the contribution of each measurement to\\nthe indicators’ value provided very useful information about\\nthe origin of the source of the threshold crossing. Some\\nof the selected features produced signiﬁcantly high scores\\nduring the training phase, as they contain most of the data\\nvariability in such conditions. However, some of the features\\nwith lower scores were determinant in the detection of some\\nfaults, proving the need to include such features to provide\\naccurate diagnosis information. This information could be used\\nnot only to detect the fault automatically but also to guide\\nsubsequent inspection to conﬁrm the origin and extent of the\\nfault, which some industries may require before commission-\\ning replacement or repair. In order to improve the perfor-\\nmance of the proposed approach in the future investigations,\\nthe exploration of indicator combination and the comparison\\nof measurements with historic data and previous operations\\nfor building conﬁdence in diagnosis is suggested.

Introduction \\nThe dataset presented here was acquired for the study of degradation in linear \\nactuators, particularly electro-mechanical actuators (EMA). The data was acquired \\nfrom an instrumented rig (described in section 2) where a ball-screw actuator moved \\nleft to right following a defined motion profile with a level of load selected by the user. Nut position and motor current measurements were acquired during the tests. Initially the rig was tested in normal conditions (absence of faults) under different \\nmotion and loading scenarios. Subsequently different mechanical faults, including lack \\nof lubrication, spalling and backlash, were seeded in the system. Position and motor \\ncurrent data were acquired under these conditions to study monitoring methods to \\ndetect faults and degradation in this particular type of systems.

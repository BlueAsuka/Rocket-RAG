I found some information related to troubleshooting lack of lubrication in linear actuors. Here are some snippets from the search results:\\n   - \"Additionally, make sure that the actuator is properly lubricated as lack of lubrication can also cause strange noises.\"\\n   - \"Most troubles with the ZCA are due to lubrication, selection, and installation problems.\"\\n   - \"The goal was to detect and classify 4 states of a linear actuator: normal, backlash, lack of lubrication, and spalling.\"\\n   - \"Good morning guys, I salvaged a captive linear actuator, tried moving it with easy driver, but I have several problems.\"\\n\\n## SEARCH RESULTS\\nThe search results provide detailed information on lack of lubrication in linear actuators, including the importance of proper lubrication, maintenance tips, recovery methods, and troubleshooting steps.\\n\\n## RECOMMENDATIONS \\nThe lack of lubrication in linear actuators is a critical issue that can lead to various problems such as strange noises and equipment failure. Proper lubrication is essential, and using the right type of lubricant based on the actuator\\'s construction is crucial. Detecting and classifying the actuator\\'s state, including lack of lubrication, is vital for maintenance. Lack of appropriate lubrication is the primary failure mode in roller screws and roller screw actuors. Establishing a maintenance schedule, avoiding overgreasing, and understanding the importance of lubrication in separating machine components are key steps to prevent lubrication-related issues.\\n\\nRecovery methods for lack of lubrication in linear actuators include troubleshooting steps. Topics covered include compact and light-weight spring cylinder linear actuators, flushing saltwater to prevent harm to motors, valve and actuator types, lubricant depletion analysis, temperature issues due to lack of lubrication, dry film lubrication best practices, lubrication fill procedures for linear clutch actuators, compliance methods, and troubleshooting charts for common actuator problems. Specific issues related to lack of lubrication in linear actuators include strange noises, troubles with selection and installation, detecting normal states, backlash, lack of lubrication, and spalling. Additional troubleshooting steps can be provided upon request.'"
